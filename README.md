# Face recognition
This repository contains code for detecting faces in images and videos. Encodings of faces from an image dataset is created. My repository [createDataset](https://github.com/YussifIbrahim/createDataset) shows how to create an image dataset. For face recognition, encodings of detected faces in the test image or video is formed which is compared to the encoding of faces created initially from the dataset. The program is then able to recognise known face and unknown faces.

## Path changes-
This code does not parse arguments from command terminal so you would need to replace paths in the code. Parsing of arguments on the command prompt will be added later
