# Detect_faces-
This repository contains code for detecting faces in images and videos. Encodings of faces from an image dataset is created. My repository https://github.com/YussifIbrahim/createDataset shows how to create an image dataset. For face recognition, Faces are detected in the test image and compared to the encoding of faces created initially from the dataset. The program is then able to recognise known face and unknown faces.

## Path changes-
This code does not parse arguments from command terminal so you would need to replace paths in the code. Parsing of arguments on the command prompt will be added later
